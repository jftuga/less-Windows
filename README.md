# less-Windows [![nightly](https://github.com/jftuga/less-Windows/actions/workflows/nightly.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jftuga/less-Windows/actions/workflows/nightly.yml)

GNU [less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_\(Unix\)) compiled for Windows 10 from the [less source](http://greenwoodsoftware.com/less/).

A stand-alone 64-bit Windows 10 binary for `less.exe` is provided on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/jftuga/less-Windows/releases).

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jftuga/less-Windows/actions) - A new build is attempted each day.  A successful build only occurs when a new version is built (upstream has been updated).  Otherwise, a failure is normally seen when there is not a new upstream version.  The `GitHub Actions` version is compiled with `Visual Studio 2019`.
